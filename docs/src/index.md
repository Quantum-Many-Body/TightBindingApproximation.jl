## Introduction

Tight binding approximation for free quantum lattice systems based on the [QuantumLattices](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/QuantumLattices.jl) pack.

## Installation

In Julia **v1.8+**, please type `]` in the REPL to use the package mode, then type this command:

```julia
pkg> add TightBindingApproximation
```

## Getting Started

[Examples of tight binding approximation for quantum lattice system](@ref examples)

## Note

Due to the fast development of this package, releases with different minor version numbers are **not** guaranteed to be compatible with previous ones **before** the release of v1.0.0. Comments are welcomed in the issues.

## Python counterpart
[HamiltonianPy](https://github.com/waltergu/HamiltonianPy): in fact, the authors of this Julia package worked on the python package at first and only turned to Julia later.
